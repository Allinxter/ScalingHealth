1.0.8
Removed: A debug line I accidentally left in.

1.0.7
Added: A config to control how many heart crystal shards drop from each ore. Note that fortune can double the base amount.
Changed: Many difficulty configs can now be set to negative values, allowing far greater control over the difficulty system!
Behind the scenes: Updated the config class to the Silent Lib "AdaptiveConfig". Currently this is not being used for anything, but your config file will now track the last build you used.

1.0.6
Added: Config to lose difficulty on death. Set to a negative number if you want to GAIN difficulty on death. Defaults to 0.
Added: Separate config for hearts dropped by passive mobs (defaults to 0.1%, hostile rate is 1%).
Added: Difficulty per kill config. Defaults to 0, set it to something else to increase difficulty for every hostile mob killed.

1.0.5
Added: Config option for damage scaling on mobs (#20)
Added: Config options for position of difficulty meter. Negative numbers will place it some distance from the right/bottom edge of the screen. (#19)
Added: Config options to add extra heart crystal ore veins based on distance from spawn (#16)
Added: Keybindings to show/hide difficulty meter (#15)

1.0.4-44
Fixed: Heart containers not being consumed when used on 1.10.2.

1.0.4-42
Fixed: Heart containers not functioning on 1.10.2.

1.0.4-41
First XCompat build released
Added: Some special blight death messages for comedic effect.

1.0.3
Added: A config to specify the amount of health lost when a player dies (defaults to 0). The old "Lose Health on Death" config is no longer used.

1.0.2
Added: "Distance and Time" difficulty mode: adds together the "Weighted Average" and "Distance from Spawn" modes. You may need to adjust some other values in the config to make the increases manageable.
Fixed (1.11 only): Textures not loading.

1.0.1
Added: Configs for difficulty meter (under the client category)
Fixed: Difficulty meter displaying at all times... did that for debugging and forgot to remove it.

1.0.0
Added: A config option to disable blight death messages... What, you don't like seeing "Blight Squid drowned" for the 50th time?
Changed: Improved heart rendering a bit
Fixed: A bug where the config file would fail to load if the length of the heart colors list was changed.

0.2.7
Added: Config option to replace blights being on fire with a particle effect (enabled by default). This is more reliable, as it works on fire-proof mobs. Current effect likely needs work...
Added: Additional configs for blights (fire resistance, invisibility, supercharged creepers).
Changed: Default hearts dropped by blights to 0-2 (up from 0-1, update your configs if desired)

0.2.6
Still attempting to solve a weird crash (see issue #9). Additional info should be dumped to the log.
Added: Blights drop extra XP now (configurable, default 10x).
Changed: Default hearts dropped by blights to 0-1 (down from 1-2). Update your config files!

0.2.5
Added: A config to disable modification of player health. Set to false if you want another mod to handle player health.
Fixed: A server crash (java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: net/silentchaos512/scalinghealth/client/HeartDisplayHandler)
Fixed: Heart color configs not being padded with 0's. This had no effect on the behavior of the configs, but could be confusing to users.

0.2.4
Added: A blacklist for extra health and a blacklist for blights. Note that if a mob is blacklisted for extra health, it cannot become a blight.
Added: Config to specify extra heart colors.
Added: Death message when blights are killed by something other than a player.
Fixed: 'Allow Hostile Extra Health' and 'Allow Peaceful Extra Health' configs not working.

0.2.3
Added: All players are now alerted when a blight is killed.
Added: Blights now drop heart canisters when killed (1-2 by default)
Changed: Blights while now reignite after a few seconds if their fire goes out.
Changed: Difficulty bar now displays both area and player difficulty (the lower quarter of the bar is player difficulty)
Fixed: A probable crash with the difficulty bar, if max difficulty is zero.
Fixed: Config option to render the difficulty bar being ignored.

0.2.2
Added: A difficulty bar. Displays for a short time occasionally. Feedback appreciated.
Fixed: Health modifiers being wrong when other modifiers are already applied.
Fixed: Heart rendering when player has regen.

0.2.1
Added: Heart Crystal Ore. Drops shards that can be used to craft heart containers...
Added: Group difficulty bonus. The area difficulty increases a bit more for each additional player in the area (configurable)
Added: Idle difficulty increase multiplier. By default, difficulty increase per second is slower when the player is not moving. Set it to a number greater than one is you want faster increase when idle.
Fixed: Player's health displaying incorrectly after traveling between dimensions.
Fixed: Hearts not shaking on low health.
Fixed: Mobs with low health getting a larger boost on "MULTI" health scaling modes.

0.2.0
WARNING: A new save system has been implemented! It should be much more reliable, but your current health and difficulty will reset to default values. Use the "/scalinghealth" command to correct that. Deleting your current main.cfg config file is not required, but recommended.
Added: A player-based difficulty system. Each player will track a difficulty level. Should be good for servers.
Added: Area difficulty modes. When a mob spawns, an "area difficulty" value is calculated. This has several configurable modes, most of which will consider all nearby players to determine the difficulty. There are also options to use distance from the world spawn or origin. By default, a weighted average is used, with the weights being based on the distance of each player from the mob. In other words, the difficulty of closer players has a bigger impact.
Changed: Difficulty per tick changed to per second. Should make the values easier for some people to understand (no e-notation in the default value), and help with rounding errors. To get the value you want, try 'max_difficulty / (hours_to_max_difficulty * 3600)'.
Fixed: Heart containers being consumed at max health.
Possibly Fixed: Some problems with health getting reset. Not tested, but some or all of these issues may have been fixed by the new save system.

0.1.3
Added: Multiple health scaling modes. Defaults to MULTI_HALF.
        - ADD: The old method, adds a flat value based on difficulty.
        - MULTI: Applies a multiplier to health instead, so health increases are proportional to base max health.
        - MULTI_HALF: Same as MULTI, but the multiplier for higher health mobs is lower.
        - MULTI_QUARTER: Same as MULTI_HALF, but the multiplier reduction is even greater (max health is lower than MULTI_HALF and MULTI)
Added: A way to change the hard-coded max health limit (uses ASM, I don't think there's any other way)
Added: An ASM config file that has an option to change the max health cap (config/scalinghealth/asm.cfg). Defaults to 2048, twice the vanilla cap.
Added: A ding sound plays when using a heart container.
Fixed: Some mobs not being healed to the correct health. For real this time!
Fixed: The health modifier for mobs being calculated wrong if other modifiers are present.

0.1.2
Added: Custom health rendering now implemented.
Added: Some attribute modifier debug info. Displayed through WIT (not a dependency)
Changed: Main config file moved to its own folder (config/scalinghealth/main.cfg).
Fixed: Some mobs not having current health set correctly on spawn.
Fixed: Mob attack damage modifiers not being right...
Fixed: Heart Container model not loading.

0.1.1
Changed the way attribute modifiers are applied.

0.1.0
Initial alpha release.
